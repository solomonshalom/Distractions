This repository contains the list of around ~400k hosts to protect your family from the dangers of the internet.

## How to set it up
I understand that not everyone who checks out this repository will quite understand the process behind setting up or even the terms. So, here are few ways to do it:

1. Leechblocker
   A super effective blocker that has tons of features, mostly tailored to those who are recovering from a addiction. Check it out [here](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/)
2. UBlock
   Mostly for ad and malware block, it's still as effective but not tailored to those w/ addictions. Know more about it [here](https://ublockorigin.com/)

In most cases, this should be alright but if your a recovering addict and need more control *other* than this, check out [Bulldog Blocker](https://www.bulldog-blocker.com/) for android and [Purge](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/purge-porn-blocker-safe-dns/id303399377) for IOS. Combine these tools around your house and you should be good!
